# Access COGITATE data

To facilitate access to our data, we offer two main avenues:


## 1. **Archival (bundles) Format**:

   This approach involves providing a collection of links to bundles of data and accompanying metadata. These links grant users the ability to download specific modalities, example datasets, or the complete dataset. Access to these resources requires a registration process on our website: **[LINK]**.

TODO:



* Add bundles description from [bundles.doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1qzN0OEqvXY2UsCHMOpV4jQStVEikec7zfLRa7hgT0t4/edit)


## 2. **"Live" Database Release**:

   Our "live" release involves an XNAT database instance that contains our data. This database offers a web interface for navigating the data and an API for programmatically retrieving specific datasets based on user interests. Comprehensive instructions on how to register, access, and query our database are provided in the subsequent sections.

By disseminating our data through these two avenues, we endeavor to make it accessible and usable for a wide range of scientific investigations.

Introduce** sample data**:



* used as ground truth for analyses pipelines
* useful to get familiarized with the data structure and contents

Explain that users need to register in both of these "avenues" bc we want to keep track of who is using and also user agreement stuff please be nice….

**Add detailed organization of bundles and xnat projects**
