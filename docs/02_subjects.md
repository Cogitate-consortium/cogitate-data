# Subjects

The Cogitate dataset is a comprehensive collection of neuroimaging data, encompassing a total of 256 subjects. The majority of these participants are right-handed (229 out of 256), with a median age of 23 years. To ensure the integrity of the study, all investigations were conducted by impartial research teams, devoid of any theoretical bias, thereby mitigating the risk of confirmation bias.

The dataset is unique in its multi-modal approach, employing three distinct neuroimaging techniques: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (M-EEG), and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Specifically, the fMRI modality included 120 healthy volunteers, all of whom were above the age of 18 and predominantly right-handed. These participants had no known history of psychiatric or neurological disorders and were recruited from the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center and the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging.

Similarly, the M-EEG modality comprised 102 healthy subjects, also above the age of 18, with no known psychiatric or neurological issues. These participants were sourced from the Centre for Human Brain Health at the University of Birmingham and the Center for MRI Research of Peking University.

In contrast, the iEEG modality involved a more specialized cohort of 34 patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy. These participants ranged in age from 10 to 65 years, had an IQ above 70, and met specific health criteria. They were recruited from multiple medical centers specializing in epilepsy treatment, such as the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at New York University, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston Children’s Hospital, and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.
