# Subjects

The full Cogitate dataset includes 256 subjects, mostly right handed (229), with a median age of 23 years.

All investigations were carried out by impartial teams with no theoretical bias to prevent confirmation bias. We assessed the predictions of the theories using 256 participants who completed an identical behavioral task using three distinct neuroimaging techniques: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, N=120), magnetoencephalography (MEEG, N=102), and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG, N=34).
