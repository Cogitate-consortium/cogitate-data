# Introduction

[COGITATE](https://www.arc-cogitate.com/) is a groundbreaking endeavor within Open Science, featuring a pre-registered adversarial collaboration aimed at resolving the debate between two prominent theories of consciousness: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace theory (GNW). This initiative encompasses eleven distinct research institutions spanning three continents, utilizing three distinct neuroimaging methods in human neuroscience—fMRI, M-EEG, and iEEG—across an extensive cohort of human volunteers and patients. A comprehensive outline of Experiment 1 is available in our **[pre-registration document](https://osf.io/gm3vd)**, **[preprint manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.23.546249v2)**, and forthcoming publication.

The primary objective of this data release is to provide a comprehensive dataset that will enable further research in the field of consciousness studies. By making our data publicly available, we aim to foster transparency, encourage reproducibility, and facilitate collaborative efforts in unraveling the complexities of human consciousness.

This data release encompasses a wide array of data types, including but not limited to:



* Behavioral Data
* Eye Tracking Data
* Neurophysiological Data
* MRI Data

For a detailed description of each data type and its corresponding file formats, please refer to the "Data Description" and "File Type Glossary" sections. 

The dataset is intended for use by researchers, clinicians, and data scientists interested in the study of consciousness.

Users are required to register to access or download data. By registering, users agree to restrictions against attempting to identify study participants and redistributing the data to third parties. Proper acknowledgment of the data resource is also mandatory.

We would like to extend our gratitude to all team members and participants who have made this study and data release possible.
