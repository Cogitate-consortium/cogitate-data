# Introduction

This document provides guidance and detailed information on the datasets released by COGITATE, how to access them, the directory structure, and a description on various types of data acquired for each modality.

## Updates

This is the first version (V1.0) of the COGITATE data release document. New updates or any changes to the previous versions will be announced here, and as a versioned document [here](https://github.com/Cogitate-consortium/cogitate-data/raw/main/assets/documentation_v1.0/MEEG-DR-doc_2024-03-18_v1.0.pdf) as well.

In V1.0, we released a subset of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data (batch 1) in the Brain Imaging Data Structure ([BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) format. It includes data from 48 subjects who participated in Experiment 1, packaged in a Bundle format.

**The demography of subjects for this release can be found in an excel document [here](https://github.com/Cogitate-consortium/cogitate-data/raw/main/assets/documentation_v1.0/linked_files_v1.0/2024-03-18_cog_meeg_exp1_batch1_bids.xlsx).**

## Future Releases

Here are the items that will be released soon:

### Experiment 1

* BIDS format of the rest of the M-EEG data along with the unprocessed/raw data
* Unprocessed/raw and BIDS format of fMRI and iEEG data

**M-EEG, MEEG, M/EEG, MEG/EEG or MEG might be used interchangeably throughout this document or the name of data folders, but all of them pertain to a singular data. This also applies to iEEG and ECoG (Electrocorticography).**
