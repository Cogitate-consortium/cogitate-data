This document provides guidance and detailed information on the datasets released by COGITATE, how to access them, the directory structure, and a description on various types of data acquired for each modality.

## Updates

This is the second version (V1.1) of the COGITATE data release document. New updates or any changes to the previous versions will be announced here, and as a versioned document [here](https://github.com/Cogitate-consortium/cogitate-data/raw/main/assets/documentation_v1.0/MEEG-DR-doc_2024-03-18_v1.0.pdf) as well.
