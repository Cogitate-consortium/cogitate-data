[COGITATE](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.arc-cogitate.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1691514940815048&usg=AOvVaw1SwgxzULrjeW7HPrQvnYBR) is a groundbreaking endeavor within Open Science, featuring a pre-registered adversarial collaboration aimed at resolving the debate between two prominent theories of consciousness: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace theory (GNW). This initiative encompasses eleven distinct research institutions spanning three continents, utilizing three distinct neuroimaging methods in human neuroscience—fMRI, M-EEG, and iEEG—across an extensive cohort of human volunteers and patients. A comprehensive outline of Experiment 1 is available in our pre-registration document [LINK], pre-print manuscript [LINK], and forthcoming publication.
