# Experiments

The Cogitate consortium performed two experiments: Exp1 & Exp2. The goals of these experiments were ….


## Experiment 1: Neural Activity and Conscious Perception

The primary aim of Experiment 1 is to investigate neural activity in response to consciously perceived stimuli. Two key factors were manipulated: the relevance of the stimulus to the task and the duration of stimulus perception. This design allows for the testing of several hypotheses, including the separation of consciousness-related activations from task-related activations and the identification of brain regions that convey information about the content of consciousness.

The experiment follows a 3x3x4x2 factorial design, covering factors such as stimulus relevance, duration, category, and orientation. Sample sizes were determined based on common practices, resulting in 122 subjects for fMRI, 102 for M-EEG, and 34 for iEEG. All subjects met specific criteria, including age and health conditions, to ensure data quality. Protocol changes due to different acquisition modalities have been documented. The task code and stimuli are available in our repositories for further examination.


~~## Experiment 2: Video Game Engagement and Neural Activity~~



### Objectives and Design

The primary aim of Experiment 1 is to investigate neural activity in response to stimuli that are consciously perceived. This experiment is designed to manipulate two key factors:



1. **Relevance of the Stimulus to the Task**: This factor is categorized into three levels—Task-relevant target, Task-relevant non-target, and Task-irrelevant stimulus.
2. **Stimulus Duration**: The stimuli are presented for durations of 500ms, 1000ms, and 1500ms.

This design framework allows us to test several key hypotheses, including:



* Disentangling consciousness-related activations from task-related activations.
* Identifying brain regions that convey information about the content of consciousness.
* Examining the persistence of the content of consciousness over time.

The experiment aims to test competing predictions of the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNW) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT). A secondary objective is to identify potential neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs).

  
### Factorial Design

The experiment follows a 3x3x4x2 factorial design, with the following factors:



* **Relevance of Stimulus to the Task**: Task-relevant target / Task-relevant non-target / Task-irrelevant stimulus.
* **Stimulus Duration**: 500ms / 1000ms / 1500ms.
* **Stimulus Category**: Faces / Objects / Letters / False-fonts.
* **Stimulus Orientation**: Side view / Front view.


### Sample Size

The sample sizes were determined based on common practices in the literature, resulting in a total of 122 subjects for fMRI, 102 for M-EEG, and 34 for iEEG. All subjects met specific criteria, including age and health conditions, to ensure data quality.


### Task Description and Protocol Changes

The task involves a series of visual stimuli presented to the subjects, as detailed in the pre-registration figures. Due to different acquisition modalities, some changes in the protocol were necessary. These changes are documented and can be compared with the original protocol.


### Code and Stimuli Repositories

The task code for all modalities is available in a single repository. The stimuli used in the experiment can be accessed from the stimuli folder.
