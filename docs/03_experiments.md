# Experiments

    TODO:
    * Intro: The Experiments performed by the Cogitate consortium were Exp1 & Exp 2.

    * The goals were…

    * What's in this release: Only Experiment 1 all modalities (see Acquisition Modalities section). More info in the methods section here -> link to publication

The overarching aim of Experiment 1 is to measure neural activity in response to stimuli that are consciously perceived. The experiment is designed to manipulate two key factors:



1. The relevance of the stimulus to the task at hand.
2. The duration for which the stimulus is perceived.

This design allows us to test several key predictions, including the disentanglement of consciousness-related activations from task-related ones, the identification of areas conveying information about the content of consciousness, and the examination of the persistence of the content of consciousness over time.

The primary objective is to test competing predictions of the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNW) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT). A secondary objective is to identify potential neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs).

The experiment follows a 3x3x4x2 factorial design, with the following factors:



* **Relevance of Stimulus to the Task**: Task-relevant target / Task-relevant non-target / Task-irrelevant stimulus.
* **Stimulus Duration**: 500ms / 1000ms / 1500ms.
* **Stimulus Category**: Faces / Objects / Letters / False-fonts.
* **Stimulus Orientation**: Side view / Front view.

The sample sizes were determined based on common practices in the literature, resulting in a total of 122 subjects for fMRI, 102 for M-EEG, and 34 for iEEG. All subjects met specific criteria, including age and health conditions, to ensure data quality.

	TODO:
    * Explain task w/ figures from pre registration
    * Describe changes of protocol because of acquisition modality
    * Link to the task code repository [one repo for all modalities] 
    * Link to the stimuli folder
    * End by mentioning that data for Experiment 2 (video game) will be part of a follow up release…
