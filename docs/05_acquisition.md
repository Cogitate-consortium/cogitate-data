# Acquisition Modalities

The Cogitate dataset encompasses three distinct neuroimaging modalities, along with synchronized eye-tracking and behavioral data linked to one of these modalities.

## fMRI data acquisition

Anatomical and functional MRI data were acquired on two 3T Prisma scanners (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), using 32-channel head coils. Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (MP-RAGE; GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2, TR/TE = 2300/3.03 ms, voxel size 1 mm isotropic, 8° flip angle). Functional images were acquired using a whole-brain T2-weighted multiband-4 sequence (time repetition [TR] / time echo [TE] = 1500/39.6 ms, 68 slices, voxel size 2 mm isotropic, 75° flip angle, A/P phase encoding direction, FOV = 210 mm, BW = 2090 Hz/Px). In addition, a single band reference image was acquired before each run. To allow for signal stabilization, the first three volumes of each run were discarded. Additional scans using the same T2-weighted sequence, but with inverted phase encoding direction (inverted RO/PE polarity), were collected at multiple points throughout the experiments.

Data for Experiment 1 was acquired from 120 Subject in 2 locations:

- Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging (DCCN)
- Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC)

Standard Operating Procedures for both locations can be found in the following links:
