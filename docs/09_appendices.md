## Appendix 1. Screening Form

### M-EEG Screening Form

This questionnaire should be filled by the participant before the experiment. It asks for some information such as name, weight (kg), email, data of birth and phone number of the subject following by a couple of questions including:

* Have you participated in a MEG study before?
* Do you suffer from any medical condition that may be relevant (e.g. epilepsy, diabetes, asthma)?
* Do you suffer from claustrophobia?
* Have you been formally diagnosed with attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (AD(H)D)?
* Have you been formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?
* Other information (e.g. spectacle prescription)

### fMRI Screening Form

Before participating in the experiment, subjects were asked to provide information on various aspects, including personal details (name, birthdate, age, sex, email, telephone), visual and hearing acuities, neurologic/psychiatric history, medical history, and handedness. Below is the list of questions asked:

**Visual Acuity**

* How would you rate your vision? [Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor]
* Do you use corrective lenses (e.g., glasses & contact lenses)? [Yes, No]
* If “Yes” to question 2, which form of corrective lenses do you use? [Glasses, Soft contact lenses, Hard contact lenses, Lenses prescription, if known]
* Are you color-blind? [Yes, No]
* Which is your dominant eye? [Left, Right]

**Hearing Acuity**

* How would you rate your hearing? [Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor]
* Do you use assistive listening devices (e.g. hearing aids)? [Yes, No]

**Neurologic/Psychiatric and Medical History**

* Do you currently suffer from any neurologic or psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder)? [Yes, ----, No]
* Have you previously been diagnosed with any neurologic or psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder)? [Yes, ----, No]
* Have you ever experienced a loss of consciousness (e.g., concussion or coma)? [Yes, Date/duration of LOC, No]

**Handedness**

* Which is your dominant hand? [Left, Right, Ambidextrous]

**Participation**

* Are you interested in participating in this study? [Yes, No]

## Appendix 2. Case Report Form

This form was for reporting any issues that might have happened during the experiment. After the end of the experiment and saving the data, the operator filled out this form.

### M-EEG Case Report Form

For M-EEG modality, the below items were asked for different sections of the data acquisition (Data for Empty Room, Resting-state, run 1, …, run 5) in the Case Report Form:

* Eye tracking not working
* Eye tracking showing bad patterns
* Problems in task performance
* Strong head motion
* Strong body motion
* Trigger monitoring
* Bad MEG sensors
* Bad EEG sensors
* Notes: explaining about the issue in a more detail

### iEEG Case Report Form

The iEEG case report form contained essential details such as the subject's ID, task name, and the distance from the stimulus interface to the subject in centimeters. It also included comprehensive information about the eye-tracking setup, specifying which eye was tracked, the sampling rate, calibration method, pupil shape, and camera lens used. Additionally, trigger information, including the trigger channels utilized and other relevant parameters, was documented. Furthermore, some fields were provided for notes and miscellaneous information. Here are the specific fields listed in the iEEG case report form:

* Subject ID
* Task Name
* Stimulus Interface Computer Name
* Distance (cm)
* Practice Run
* Pre-Task Equipment Disinfected
* Post-Task Equipment Disinfected
* Other
* Notes
* Screen Brightness
* Eye Tracking Sticker
* Glasses or Lenses
* Trigger Information:
  * Trigger Channel
  * Trigger Reference Channel
  * Trigger Channel Gain
  * Audio Channels
* Eye Tracker Setup:
  * Eye Tracked
  * Sampling Rate
  * Calibration Type
  * Pupil
  * Camera Lens

### fMRI Case Report Form

fMRI CRF included fields to document various aspects of the experimental session and data collection process. Below is a list of these fields with brief explanations:

* **Eyetracker_calibration_quality:** This field assessed the quality of calibration for the eye-tracking system used during the fMRI session.
* **Errors_problems_setup:** This section recorded any errors or problems encountered during the setup phase of the fMRI experiment, such as issues with equipment configuration or initial software setup.
* **Practice_quantity:** This field recorded the quantity of practice sessions conducted by participants before the actual fMRI runs. Practice sessions helped familiarize participants with tasks and procedures.
* **notes_run1** through **notes_run8:** These fields provided space to record specific notes or observations for each of the eight functional runs (DurR1 to DurR8) conducted during the fMRI session. Notes included participant behavior, task performance, or any technical issues encountered during each run.
* **notes_t1** and **notes_t1_-_2:** These fields captured notes or observations related to the T1 anatomical scan, which was conducted at the beginning of the fMRI session to obtain high-resolution structural images of the brain.
* **Errors_problems_after_scanning:** This section documented any errors or issues that occurred after the completion of the scanning sessions, which could impact data quality or require follow-up actions.

## Appendix 3. Exit Questionnaire

This Form should be filled by the participant after the experiment and asks the below questions:

* How difficult was it to stay focused for the entire duration of the experiment?
* Did you notice that the stimuli duration varied?
* When stimuli were presented for a short period of time, were you able to focus on them for as long as they were presented?
* When stimuli were presented for a medium period of time, were you able to focus on them for as long as they were presented?
* When stimuli were presented for a long period of time, were you able to focus on them for as long as they were presented?
* Was it difficult to keep the targets in memory for the entirety of a block?
* For each stimulus category, how hard was it to recognize them among the other stimuli? [Faces]
* For each stimulus category, how hard was it to recognize them among the other stimuli? [Object]
* For each stimulus category, how hard was it to recognize them among the other stimuli? [Letters]
* For each stimulus category, how hard was it to recognize them among the other stimuli? [Symbols]
* Were specific stimuli orientations harder to recognize than others?
* If yes, which ones?
* What did you think of the block length?
* Would the task have been easier if the stimulus duration didn't vary so much?
* Do you have any additional comments to share?
